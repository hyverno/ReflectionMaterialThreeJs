## Presentation
Hi, I am a frontend developer specializing in creative design. I'm passionate about 3D rendering, script optimization and the JV world in general.

I mainly use VueJs and Angular. This allows me to deploy applications easily and quickly. For my backend I mainly use Firebase, which allowed me to get familiar with HTTPS requests and CRUD in general. In order to create immersive experiences I sometimes integrate ThreeJs.
